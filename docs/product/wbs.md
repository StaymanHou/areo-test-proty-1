## Phase 1 — Flight PoC

### WP1: Project skeleton & dev loop — DONE 2026-04-19
**Description:** Initialize the Vite + TypeScript + Three.js + Rapier project. Empty scene renders, HMR works, Stats.js + lil-gui in place behind `?debug=true`. Establishes module layout from arch.md.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** none
**Size:** S (actual: ~S)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `npm create vite@latest` (TS template), install three, @dimforge/rapier3d-compat, lil-gui, stats.js
- [x] Scaffold `src/` module layout (engine/, world/, aircraft/, mission/, hud/ as empty dirs per arch.md D5)
- [x] `main.ts` boots: Three.js renderer + canvas, Rapier world init (async await — WASM load), empty render loop
- [x] Stats.js FPS counter visible; lil-gui panel visible only with `?debug=true`
- [x] README with `npm run dev` / `npm run build` / how to open debug mode
- [x] `CONVENTIONS.md` documenting right-handed Y-up coordinates (arch D7)

### WP2: Fixed-timestep game loop — DONE 2026-04-19
**Description:** Implement the decoupled physics-tick / render-tick loop from arch D1. Accumulator pattern, physics at 60 Hz, render at monitor refresh. No aircraft yet — just prove the loop with a falling cube.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP1
**Size:** S (actual: ~S)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `engine/loop.ts`: accumulator-pattern tick, configurable physics dt, spiral-of-death clamp, pause support. 7 Vitest tests codify behavior.
- [x] Falling-cube demo: Rapier rigid body + Three.js mesh, synced each render frame (Rapier world gravity, static ground collider, dynamic cube)
- [x] Verified stable under frame drops (tab backgrounding) and CPU throttling (6×)

### WP3: Input + camera — DONE 2026-05-04
**Description:** Keyboard + mouse input state with rebindable map. Chase camera (follows body at offset) and cockpit camera (rigid to body). Swap with a key.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP2
**Size:** S (actual: ~S)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `engine/input.ts`: keyboard + mouse state, frame-stable reads, `wasPressed()` single-frame detection, `DEFAULT_KEY_MAP` with 14 logical actions
- [x] `world/camera.ts`: chase camera with exponential-decay damped follow, cockpit camera with rigid attach (position + quaternion copy)
- [x] `V` key swaps cameras; lil-gui "Camera" label shows active mode
- [x] Works on the falling-cube demo (camera follows the cube); 22 Vitest tests

### WP4: Aerosurface primitive — DONE 2026-05-08
**Description:** The core of the flight model. Single `AeroSurface` class: given local-frame position, orientation, area, and piecewise-linear CL/CD curves, computes force + application point from incoming airflow velocity. Unit-tested.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP1 (project skeleton)
**Size:** M (actual: ~M)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `aircraft/aerosurface.ts`: data model (position, normal, chord, area, CL/CD curve)
- [x] Airflow → angle-of-attack math (project velocity onto plane defined by `normal × chord`, measure signed angle from `−chord` direction; sign convention: flow along `−normal` → +AoA → +lift)
- [x] Piecewise-linear CL/CD lookup (`lookupLiftDragCurve`) + Gazebo-style symmetric flat-plate helper (`createSymmetricFlatPlateCurves`)
- [x] `computeAeroForce(surface, bodyState)`: force vector + world application point. Allocation-free hot path (11 module-scoped scratch buffers).
- [x] 27 Vitest cases: shape/normalization, airflow at point with rotational contribution, AoA across the full domain, curve lookup edge cases, force at α≈0/+10°/+30°, post-stall drop, drag rise, app-point world transform, sign-continuity through α=0, force-vector reuse contract.

### WP5: Flight model composition — DONE 2026-05-08
**Description:** Assemble aerosurfaces into an aircraft: main wing (L+R), horizontal stab, vertical stab. Load constants from `public/config/aircraft.json`. Apply summed forces + thrust + gravity to a Rapier rigid body. No control inputs yet.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP4
**Size:** M (actual: ~M)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `aircraft/rigidbody.ts`: `Aircraft` class — Rapier dynamic body (mass + principal inertia from config) + Three.js mesh group (fuselage + 4 surface placeholders). `syncMesh()`, `readBodyState()`.
- [x] `aircraft/flightmodel.ts`: `FlightModel` class — composes N AeroSurfaces, allocation-free per-tick aero force application, thrust along body −Z, throttle clamped [0,1].
- [x] `public/config/aircraft.json` + `aircraft/config.ts`: schema (mass, inertia Vec3, thrust.maxN, surfaces[] with named curves), light runtime validation, vector-to-Vector3 conversion. Async `loadAircraftConfig`.
- [x] Placeholder aircraft mesh (box fuselage + 4 surface boxes with named placement).
- [x] Launched at (0,50,0) with linvel (0,0,-30) at 60% fixed throttle; physics runs and the aircraft moves visibly. (Fully trimmed, stable flight requires WP6 controls + WP7 tuning — confirmed by browser verify-self.)

### WP6: Flight controls — DONE 2026-05-09
**Description:** Map input state to control-surface deflections. Aileron (roll), elevator (pitch), rudder (yaw), throttle. Controls modify aerosurface orientations (aileron) or add torque (simplified). Verify a pilot-like control feel.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP3, WP5
**Size:** M (actual: ~M)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `aircraft/controls.ts`: keyboard → normalized control values (−1..1) with stick-rate ramping; throttle stateful with rate ramping
- [x] Ailerons deflect L/R wings (opposite signs) via `setDeflection` rotating chord+normal about pre-baked spanAxis
- [x] Elevator deflects the horizontal stab; rudder deflects the v-stab; signs determined empirically by per-axis body-torque tests
- [x] Throttle modulates thrust [0..1] (replaces the WP5 hard-coded 0.6)
- [x] Lil-gui Controls folder with live readouts + rebindable key fields (gated on `?debug=true`)
- [x] CONVENTIONS.md documents +aileron→roll right, +elevator→nose up, +rudder→nose right, deflection-via-spanAxis model
- [x] 37 new tests; 106/106 pass; verified end-to-end at localhost:5173

### WP7: Flight-feel tuning pass
**Description:** The decisive feel task per R2. Iterate on flight model constants (CL slopes, stall α, mass, inertia, thrust, control authority, damping) until flying feels right. Capture the working preset.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP6
**Size:** L
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Expose all flight-model constants in lil-gui with live-apply
- [ ] "Export preset" button writes current values back to `aircraft.json` shape
- [ ] Tuning sessions: takeoff roll, level flight, banking, pitching, stall recovery
- [ ] Cross-check feel with casual player (one external pair of eyes)
- [ ] Commit tuned preset as the default `aircraft.json`

### WP8: Phase 1 world (flat terrain + skybox + landmarks) — DONE 2026-05-09
**Description:** Per arch D4, flat textured ground plane + skybox + 2–3 placed landmarks (runway, control tower) for spatial reference. Rapier ground collider. Runs at 60fps.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP1
**Size:** S (actual: ~M — the back-loop fix for the cubemap upload-path contract added a half-day)
**Tasks:**
- [x] `world/terrain.ts` with the arch-defined interface (`getHeight`, `getMesh`, `getColliderDesc` — descriptor-not-collider, slight rename from arch.md's `getCollider`)
- [x] Flat textured plane + static Rapier collider (4000m × 4000m, procedural checker DataTexture)
- [x] Skybox (procedural CubeTexture, 6 faces × 256², gradient sky + sun on +X)
- [x] Placed runway (30m × 600m along world Z, painted on terrain — no separate collider) + a single landmark tower (8m × 30m at world (40, 0, -250) with static cuboid collider)
- [x] Sanity-check 60fps budget with the aircraft flying (60fps Chrome + 60.19fps Playwright headless)

### WP9: Phase 1 verification
**Description:** Meets Phase 1 exit criteria. Deployable dev build; a developer can open the URL, take off, fly around, and crash; 60fps on a mid-range laptop in Chrome/Safari/Firefox.
**Phase:** 1
**Dependencies:** WP2, WP3, WP7, WP8
**Size:** S
**Tasks:**
- [ ] End-to-end playthrough: takeoff, fly, land-or-crash
- [ ] FPS check on Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- [ ] Phase 1 playtest: a non-developer flies and it feels right (or loop back to WP7)

## Phase 2 — Mission System MVP

**Note:** Phase 2 opens with a brief arch revision (see P8 back-loop risk) to decide the mission framework and HUD approach. That work is WP10 below, before the mission-type WPs.

### WP10: Phase 2 arch revision — mission + HUD framework
**Description:** Decide mission framework shape (declarative JSON? scripted? state-machine?) and HUD approach (DOM overlay vs Three.js ortho). Update `docs/product/arch.md` with a revision section. Deferred from Phase 1 arch per its "Unknowns" section.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP9
**Size:** S

### WP11: Mission framework
**Description:** Core mission runner: load a mission definition, expose objective state, detect win/lose, allow return to mission select. Read-only access to aircraft state.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP10
**Size:** M
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Mission definition schema (per WP10 decision)
- [ ] Mission lifecycle: load → start → tick → complete/fail
- [ ] Mission-select screen (minimal DOM menu)
- [ ] Return-to-select flow after mission ends

### WP12: HUD
**Description:** In-mission HUD showing altitude, airspeed, current objective, status. Approach per WP10 decision.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP10
**Size:** S

### WP13: Free flight mission
**Description:** No objectives — just fly around the map. Baseline mission type; validates the framework with the simplest case.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP11
**Size:** XS
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Mission definition: no-op objectives, infinite duration
- [ ] Exit condition: player presses a "return to menu" key

### WP14: Waypoint mission
**Description:** Ordered checkpoints in 3D space, timer, objective shows next waypoint + distance. HUD shows waypoint arrow.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP11, WP12
**Size:** S
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Waypoint entity: position, radius, index
- [ ] Objective logic: fly within radius in order
- [ ] HUD: current waypoint distance + directional arrow
- [ ] Win: last waypoint cleared. Fail: timer expires.

### WP15: Takeoff/landing mission
**Description:** Airfield with a runway. Detect wheels-down on runway within bounds + safe vertical speed. Objective: take off, pattern around, land.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP11, WP12
**Size:** M
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Runway collider + bounds
- [ ] Touchdown detection: velocity + position + orientation thresholds
- [ ] Objective phases: take off → reach altitude → return → land
- [ ] HUD: current phase, glideslope indicator (optional)

### WP16: Combat mission
**Description:** Biggest Phase 2 risk (R6). Keep minimal per research: one simple AI enemy (air or ground), one weapon, hit detection, damage model. No AI pathfinding beyond "fly toward / turn toward player."
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP11, WP12
**Size:** L
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Weapon: forward-firing projectile (gun or simple missile — pick one)
- [ ] Projectile lifecycle: spawn, raycast or collider, hit, despawn
- [ ] AI enemy: one target entity (stationary ground target OR minimally-AI aircraft). If aircraft, reuse flight model with a dumb "turn to face player" controller.
- [ ] Damage model: hitpoints on player + enemy; destruction state
- [ ] Win: enemy destroyed. Fail: player destroyed.

### WP17: Phase 2 verification
**Description:** All four mission types playable end-to-end via mission-select. Exit-criteria check.
**Phase:** 2
**Dependencies:** WP13, WP14, WP15, WP16
**Size:** S

## Phase 3 — v1 Ship

### WP18: Onboarding pass
**Description:** New player is flying within 30s. No tutorial — in-world prompts only. First-load UX.
**Phase:** 3
**Dependencies:** WP17
**Size:** M
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Boot directly into a "just fly" state or a 1-screen mission select (test both)
- [ ] On-screen key hints fade in during first minute

**Phase:** 3
**Dependencies:** WP17
**Size:** L
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Skybox: chosen art direction, 6 hi-res faces

- [ ] Lighting: directional sun + ambient

### WP21: Cross-browser QA
**Description:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox latest on desktop. 60fps on mid-range laptop. Fix compat regressions.
**Phase:** 3
**Dependencies:** WP18, WP19, WP20
**Size:** S
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test each mission in each browser
- [ ] FPS meter on mid-range hardware (user's existing laptop is the reference machine)
- [ ] Input feel check (mouse sensitivity differs per browser)
- [ ] WASM load on slow connection (throttled network in devtools)

### WP22: Deploy + share
**Description:** Pick a static host (Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages — equivalent), deploy, public URL.
**Phase:** 3
**Dependencies:** WP21
**Size:** XS

### WP23: Playtesting

**Critical path (longest chain to ship):**
`WP1 → WP4 → WP5 → WP6 → WP7 → WP9 → WP10 → WP11 → WP16 → WP17 → WP20 → WP21 → WP22 → WP23`

WP7 (flight-feel tuning) and WP16 (combat) are the two heaviest items and sit on the critical path. WP20 (visual polish) is L but trivially parallelizable with WP18/WP19.

**Parallel tracks** within Phase 1: WP4+WP5 can proceed in parallel with WP2+WP3+WP8 after WP1 lands.

## Architectural gaps found

None that require a back-loop. WP10 is a *planned* arch revision at the Phase 1→2 boundary — arch.md explicitly deferred those decisions, so this is on-plan work, not a P8 regression.

Recommend `/product-context` next (transition P9).

## Session Pause — 2026-05-09 09:05
Paused after WP6 finalize. See `workflow/.session.md` to resume.
